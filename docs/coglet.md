# Coglet Architecture

*Fractal asynchronous control for distributed agent systems.*

## 1. Primitive

**Coglet** = **COG** (control) + **LET** (execution)

- **COG** — slow, reflective, supervises and adapts LETs
- **LET** — fast, reactive, executes tasks

Recursive composition: a COG is itself a LET under a higher COG. The system forms a temporal hierarchy where layers share a uniform interface and differ only in cadence and scope.

The boundary between COG and LET is an interface contract, not a deployment topology. They may share a process, span processes, or run on different machines — the protocol is the same.


## 2. LET Interface

**LET** = Listen, Enact, Transmit

Event-driven. The framework owns the channels and dispatches to the Coglet.

| Method | Caller | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `@listen(channel)` | framework | Decorator: register a handler for a named data channel |
| `@enact(command_type)` | COG (via framework) | Decorator: register a handler for a named control command |
| `transmit(channel, result)` | self | Push output to a named channel |

`@listen` is the data plane. `@enact` is the control plane. `transmit` is the only outbound call.

```python
class MyCoglet(Coglet):
    @listen("obs")
    def handle_obs(self, data):
        self.transmit("action", self.decide(data))

    @listen("score")
    def handle_score(self, data):
        self.history.append(data)

    @enact("reload")
    def reload(self):
        self.load_config()
```


## 3. COG Interface

**COG** = Create, Observe, Guide

A COG supervises one or more LETs. The 1:1 case (one COG paired with one LET) is the common default. Fleet management is a natural extension, not a prerequisite.

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `observe(let_id, channel) → AsyncStream[Result]` | Subscribe to a named channel on a LET's transmit stream |
| `guide(let_id, command)` | Send a command to a LET's `on_enact` — fire-and-forget |
| `create(base) → CogletHandle` | Spawn a new LET from a CogBase, return its handle |

The COG's only feedback loop is observe. `guide` has no return value — the COG knows its command took effect by watching subsequent transmissions.

A COG is itself a LET under a higher COG. Its `on_message` receives the results it observes. Its `on_enact` receives directives from above. The recursion bottoms out at a LET with no COG (standalone reactive process) or a COG with no parent (root supervisor).

## 4. Capabilities

Capabilities are injected infrastructure, orthogonal to COG/LET. Any Coglet may be granted any capability at construction time.

### 4.1 Memory

```python
class Memory(Protocol):
    async def store(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None: ...
    async def retrieve(self, key: str) -> Any: ...
    async def query(self, predicate: Callable) -> List[Any]: ...
```

Backend is a deployment decision. A Coglet without memory is a valid, stateless Coglet.

## 5. Communication Model

COG and LET communicate via asynchronous channels with clear boundaries — neither can see inside the other except via the agreed protocol.

Properties:
- Location-agnostic
- Backpressure-tolerant
- Naturally distributable
- No synchronous calls — guide is fire-and-forget, observe is the only feedback path

## 6. Mixins

Optional mixins for any Coglet.

### 6.1 LifeLet

Lifecycle hooks. All no-ops by default.

| Hook | When | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `on_start()` | Channels open | Connect resources, announce presence |
| `on_stop()` | Shutdown signal | Flush state, release resources |

A hook that raises aborts the transition.

Child lifecycle (start, stop, health) is observed through the CogletHandle returned by `create()`, not through hooks on the parent.

### 6.2 GitLet

The repo *is* the policy. The Coglet executes from HEAD and accepts patches as commits.

`on_enact` for a GitLet means pull + reload. Rollback is `git revert`. Branching enables parallel policy experiments. No custom serialization — the patch protocol is just git.

### 6.3 LogLet

Adds a log stream separate from transmit. The COG subscribes to it independently.

- **transmit stream** — results, actions, decisions
- **log stream** — traces, state snapshots, metrics

The COG controls log verbosity via `guide`. Without LogLet, the COG only sees the transmit stream.

### 6.4 TickLet

Adds time-driven behavior via the `@every(interval, unit)` decorator. Any method can be scheduled to run periodically.

```python
class MyCoglet(Coglet, TickLet):
    @every(10, "m")
    def check_fleet(self):
        ...

    @every(1, "s")
    def heartbeat(self):
        ...
```

Useful for COGs that need to periodically observe their fleet and decide on interventions, or for LETs that need heartbeats, polling, or scheduled maintenance. Without TickLet, a Coglet is purely reactive to incoming events.

### 6.5 CodeLet

The Coglet's behavior is a `dict[str, Callable]`. Functions are registered and replaced at runtime via `@enact("register")`. No repo, no serialization — just live Python functions in a dict.

```python
class MyPolicy(Coglet, CodeLet):
    @listen("obs")
    def step(self, obs):
        action = self.functions["step"](obs)
        self.transmit("action", action)

    @enact("register")
    def register(self, funcs: dict[str, Callable]):
        self.functions.update(funcs)
```

Where GitLet versions behavior as commits in a repo, CodeLet keeps it in-memory as a mutable function table. Useful for fast iteration loops where persistence isn't needed.

### 6.6 MulLet

Manages N identical LETs as a single logical unit. The parent COG sees one CogletHandle.

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `create(n, config) → CogletHandle` | Spawn N copies of the same LET config |
| `map(event) → List[(let_id, event)]` | Route an incoming event to one or more children |
| `reduce(results) → Result` | Aggregate child outputs into one transmission |

Distribution policies (round-robin, broadcast, hash) are configured via `map`. The parent COG observes one reduced stream and guides one unit — the fan-out is internal.
